 <p> Last year, I took an epic journey across Europe.  I created this page to show off the photos of some of the awsome places that I saw during my vacation.</p>

  <h1> Plitvice Lakes, Croatia</h1>
  <p>The first awesome place I'd like to share with you is Plitvice Lakes in the middle of Croatia.  These are natural waterfalls that you visit by walking on wooden platforms. </p>

  <h1>The Alps</h1>
  We stayed in Grindelwald, CH and Innsbruck, AT for a few days, and hiked through the hills and valleys.  There was even a little snow at high elevations in both places!

  <h1>Como, Italy</h1>

  <p>From the Alps, we made our way south to Italy, where we stayed in an old wheat silo (yes it was basically one big tall round room, with beds in a loft).  On the rainy day, we did what any normal Pacific Northwesterner would do - we went for a day hike in the mountains!</p>
